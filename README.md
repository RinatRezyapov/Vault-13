I'm learning programming language in free time after work. 

I always wanted to create a game using javascript from scratch without using any framewroks or libraries.

This is my first attempt. I decided to make video of this process and upload it to youtube, so check this out: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLshG9vHWHGOgPIs2oarf1ZBTho5Jbg9JF

I'm not trying to use best practices while writing the code I just want to do it as simple as possible.

If you have an interesting project, especially game project feel free to contact me: rinat.rezyapov@gmail.com as I want to gain experience and change my current profession to something related to programming.

Thank you for attention!
